                    Koalytics is a next-generation biometric usability testing platform
                    that bridges the gap between human experience and digital performance.
                    Our mission is to help researchers and designers understand users on
                    a deeper level through emotion recognition and behavioral insights.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                    Built for both participants and researchers, Koalytics offers an
                    integrated environment for running usability studies with biometric
                    data such as facial expression. We combine traditional usability metrics 
                    with real-time emotional and physiological data to provide a 
                    more comprehensive picture of user experience.
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    Our vision is to empower UX researchers, educators, and developers to
                    design more empathetic, data-driven, and human-centered products. With
                    Koalytics, every interaction tells a story â€” and every emotion
                    matters.
